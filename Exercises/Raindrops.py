''' Introduction
Raindrops is a slightly more complex version of the FizzBuzz challenge, a classic interview question.
Instructions
Your task is to convert a number into its corresponding raindrop sounds.
If a given number:
    is divisible by 3, add "Pling" to the result.
    is divisible by 5, add "Plang" to the result.
    is divisible by 7, add "Plong" to the result.
    is not divisible by 3, 5, or 7, the result should be the number as a string
Examples

    28 is divisible by 7, but not 3 or 5, so the result would be "Plong".
    30 is divisible by 3 and 5, but not 7, so the result would be "PlingPlang".
    34 is not divisible by 3, 5, or 7, so the result would be "34".
'''
def convert(number):
    #Si se puede dividir por 3, agregar Pling al resultado
    #Si % 5 = 0, agregar Plang
    # Si La division por 7 da 0 de residuo, agregar Plong al resultado
    # Si no es divisible por 3, 5 o 7. el resultado deberia ser el nombre como String
    pass
